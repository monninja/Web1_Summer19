## Before you get started on coding

### Set up your local environment
* Local means your page will be on your computer and you can only get to it from your computer by clicking on the page. 
* Nobody else can see your page from the browser, unless they have your file on their computer. 
* We will be making a website that is a tribute to your favorite game or a favorite level or world you’ve built in a game, maybe even a game you’ve built.
* Start by making a folder for your website somewhere on your computer- remember where it is! 
  * Since we want to set up good habits, we recommend that you name things with names that make sense so you can find them later and know what is in those files. 
  * Example of good naming my-favorite-game-site (avoid spaces in your folder name) 

### Setting up a directory 
* The folder you just made is called a root folder
  * Your root folder is the main folder where all your files live. This is very important to note. 
* Make subfolders for your images and icons 
  * For organization sake, I like to have separate folders for images and icons.
  * These will come in handy later. 

### Getting to know your tools
* <b>Text editor</b>
  * This is where you will be writing your code and saving the file with the correct extension so the computer is able to read it. You will be making a lot of files with .html at the end. This is how a browser knows how to read your file. If you do not add .html at the end, the file is just a plain text file and the browser will not be able to read it. 
* <b>Browser</b>
 * This is the application in your computer that reads html files. 
 * We will be using Chrome for ease. 
 * A browser sends instructions to servers all over the world to show you the websites you go into everyday. 
 * When you type in a URL, for example: roblox.com, the browser knows which server to talk to about getting the images and files necessary to display the page. 
 * Roblox.com is a URL. Think of it as an address to the correct server with the files. 
 * We will get your web page online so that the whole world can access it with its own URL later.- for now, it is local. 
* <b>Inspector</b> 
  * You will see this tool again later when you learn Javascript. All you need to know about it now is that you can look at the code of any webpage and try things out without changing them in the actual code!
  * All major browsers have this tool. 
  * Go to any webpage, right click and click on Inspector in the menu (On Chrome)
  * This is an example of it in action. 
  
We did this to a friend when they weren’t looking. They got back to their computer and saw that on the page. They were stunned. It goes away when you refresh the page, though. 

  * Try it! Go on any website and try to change some of the text. 

## Let's start coding! 
Ok, I know you're eager to make your own page, so let's get started! 

### The significance of "index.html"
* Make a file called index.html and put it in the root folder you made for your game. 
* index.html files are recognized as the default file by most servers- that means, that when someone goes to your address, this is the first file they will see. 
* This is where you will write your html for the home page of your website! 

### HTML syntax: elements, attributes, and values

### Document tree

### Absolute and relative paths

### Hyperlinks

### Block-level and inline-level elements

### Ordered, unordered, & definition lists

### HTML formatting fundamentals
